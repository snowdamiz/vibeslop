# Vibeslop

> The social portfolio platform for vibe coders 🎨⚡

Vibeslop is where AI-native builders showcase their work, share their process, and connect with a community that celebrates vibe coding.

## What is Vibeslop?

A social media platform specifically for the vibe coding community—developers and creators who embrace AI-assisted development. Unlike traditional portfolios that hide the "how," Vibeslop makes the AI tools, prompts, and creative process a first-class citizen.

### Core Features

- **👥 Social Feed** - Follow builders, discover projects, engage with the community
- **🏷️ Technical Specializations** - "AI Prompting for React" is a real skill here
